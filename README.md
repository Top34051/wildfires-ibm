# IBM Call for Code Spot Challenge for Wildfires

This repository is my work on developing the solution approach for [IBM Call for Code Spot Challenge for Wildfires](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/call-for-code-spot-challenge-for-wildfires-predictions-comparing-approaches/). 
In this competition, we are forecasting the size of fire area by region in Australia for each day from January to February 2021. To predict it, we are given weather data extracted from Weather Operations Center Geospatial Analytics component (PAIRS Geoscope).

We tried multiple approaches from traditional time-series forecasting (AR, MA, ARIMA, FB Prophet, etc.), predictive machine learning models (XGBoost, RandomForest, etc.), and simple LSTM model.
